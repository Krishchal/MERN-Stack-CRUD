MERN Stack CRUD API
Overview
The MERN Stack CRUD API is a robust backend solution that allows you to manage user data through Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. 
It is built using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project demonstrates how to build a backend API that connects to a 
MongoDB database to store and manipulate user information. It supports basic user management operations such as creating a new user, retrieving user data, 
updating user details, and deleting users.

This API provides a foundation for building full-stack applications with React on the frontend, interacting with a RESTful API built using Express and Node.js.

Key Features
Create User: Add a new user with their first name, last name, email, and password.
Get All Users: Retrieve a list of all users stored in the database.
Get User by ID: Fetch a specific user’s details based on their unique ID.
Update User: Modify user details (such as first name, last name, etc.) by user ID.
Delete User: Remove a user from the database by their unique ID.

Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
Express.js: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that facilitates building RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which simplifies database operations and schema validation.
dotenv: A zero-dependency module for loading environment variables from a .env file.

Installation
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download Node.js
